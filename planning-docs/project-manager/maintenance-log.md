## 2026-01-05 - Initial Documentation Creation

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-05 (Initial session)
**Trigger**: User request - Project planning after Phase 1 completion
**Action Type**: Documentation Creation

### Actions Taken

1. **Created PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md**
   - Comprehensive project vision and context
   - Hardware specifications and constraints
   - Technology stack documentation
   - Project phases (6 phases outlined)
   - Key decisions log summary
   - Success metrics and risk assessment

2. **Created SESSION_STATE.md**
   - Current phase tracking (Phase 2 - Core GPIO UI)
   - Progress tracking (Phase 1: 100%, Overall: 12%)
   - Environment state documentation
   - Next session preparation notes
   - Context notes and pending questions

3. **Created DAILY_BACKLOG.md**
   - 9 prioritized tasks for immediate work
   - Time estimates and dependencies
   - Acceptance criteria for each task
   - Risk factors and notes
   - Velocity tracking table

4. **Created SPRINT_BACKLOG.md**
   - Sprint 1 definition (2 weeks, 2026-01-05 to 2026-01-19)
   - 10 sprint tasks organized by tracks (UI, GPIO, Visualization, Testing)
   - Dependencies and critical path identified
   - Risk assessment (4 risks documented)
   - Sprint deliverables checklist
   - Success criteria (Must Have / Should Have / Nice to Have)

5. **Created ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - 4-layer architecture diagram
   - Component details for UI, Application, HAL, Hardware layers
   - Data flow documentation
   - File organization structure
   - Error handling strategy
   - Performance considerations
   - Security and safety guidelines
   - Future expansion plans

6. **Created DECISIONS.md**
   - 10 technical decisions documented
   - Decision format: Date, Rationale, Alternatives, Confidence, Impact
   - 3 decisions under review (pending testing)
   - Decision review process defined

7. **Created completed/phase1-research-and-setup.md**
   - Phase 1 completion documentation
   - All objectives marked complete
   - Key findings summary
   - Technical decisions made
   - Time tracking (estimated 2 hours)
   - Next phase preview

8. **Created project-manager/maintenance-log.md** (this file)
   - Agent activity tracking initiated

### Files Modified
- None (all new files created)

### Patterns Identified
- User completed research phase thoroughly before requesting documentation
- Clear phase completion trigger activated documentation needs
- All required context available in RETERMINAL_INFO.md

### Next Recommended Actions
- User should begin Sprint 1 Task S1.1 (Verify Python Dependencies)
- Monitor daily backlog task completion for velocity tracking
- Update SESSION_STATE.md when first task starts (mark in_progress)

### Pending Human Review
- None at this time (initial setup complete)
